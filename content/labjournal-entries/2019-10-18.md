## Protocol 

Harvesting of the cells 
Centrifuagtion at 2500 rpm for 5 min
600µL of supernatant were used for the purification via Histrap

Histrap Purification: 
centrifuge at 4°C 
open columns a quater and placing it in a 2 mL eppi
Centrifuation at 500 rpm for 1 min
Adding 600 µL Binding buffer
Centrifugation at 500 rpm for 1 min
Adding 600µL sample 
Centrifugation at 500 rpm for 1 min
Washing with 600µL binding buffer
Centrifugation at 500 rpm for 1 min
3x Elution step: Adding 100µL Elution buffer and centrifugation at 500 rpm for 1 min

Tag-Catcher reaction:
Adding same colume K2a and K2b and incubate them 20 min at RT
For this samples: Supernatant (SN) harvest, Elution (E) 1-3

Gel running :

at 130V for 1 h with following pipetting scheme

Gel1
M, SN K1, SN K2a, SN K2b, SN K2ab, E1 K1, E1 K2a, E1 K2b, E1 K2ab, E2 K1, E2 K2a, E2 K2b, E2 K2ab

Gel 2
M, SN K1, SN K2a, SN K2b, SN K2ab, E3 K1, E3 K2a, E3 K2b, E3 K2ab

Marker 5µL, Samples 20µL (10µL sample+10µL loading dye)
After loading dye adding samples were cooked for 2 min at 95°C except the SN samples of the gel 2

Blotting: 
Both gels were blotted semidry for 1:23 h at 130mA 

Blocking: 
Membranes were blocked for 1h 45 with 10% milkpowdersolution

Primary Ab:
2 washing steps with PBST
anti-Histag ab was diluted 1:2000 in 10mL 10% milkpowdersolution and added to the membrane
Incubation overnight at 4°C
