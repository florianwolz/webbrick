Ligation of Measurement Part with cut pUC19 from earlier of the day;

Relative amounts of vector 1 : Insert 4;

10 ng of Vector and approx. 10 ng of Insert as the Insert is only 700 bp long;

Ligation with T4 DNA Ligase Protocol (M020) from NEB;

Reaction set up on ice;

Incubate @RT for 10 min;

Heat inactivate @65 for 10 min;



With the sample **Heat shock** was performed after Evas Protocol; 

The transformed cells were seeded on an Amp+ plate and placed into the incubator @ 37 °C;



For the case of a failed ligation a PCR with the measurement part was set up;

> **Problems faced / possible error causes**

 Q5 Hifi Polymerase is stored in the topmost drawer in the -20 °C fridge in the winkler lab and no longer in the Plastik Box in drawer 2;



> **Pending tasks, next steps, comments for next people in the Lab**



\- Check Plate in the Incubator and pick colonies if transformation was successful;

\- IF not new digestion with the ordered pUC19 (XbaI/EcoRI)
