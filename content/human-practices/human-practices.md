# Integrated Human Practices

Besides all the work in the lab during our project we also faced the important task to involve
the influence of society in our work. Our integrated human practice work included to inform
ourselves about the possibilities of cancer prevention, discussions with the public at certain
events and the exchange with experts in our field of research about our project, followed by
the integration of their proposals into it.

At the beginning of our project, our aim was to build different constructed bi-specific
antibodies against colorectal cancer. Therefore, we decided to inform ourselves about this
type of cancer. Before the formation of colorectal cancer there are certain possibilities for
prevention. It was important for our project to look at this aspect to sensitize ourselves
about the risks that promotes cancer and also how to support people with cancer and how
to inform the public. The Felix-Burda foundation deals with these problems, therefore we
decided to get in contact with them and gather important information. A well-known fact is
that an unhealthy lifestyle, like the consumption of fast food and cigarettes, promotes the
formation of cancer. But since the foundation was founded and started with their
informational campaign, the number of incidence of colorectal cancer decreased. Their
campaign included the creation of the colorectal cancer month in May, which engages other
organizations like hospitals, health organizations and doctors in general to inform their
patients about the risks and possible preventions of cancer. Another project is called
“Nationaler Krebsplan” where they are working together with the ministry of health to
develop further early diagnosis of colorectal cancer. Additionally they award scientists,
researching for new therapies and treatments for colorectal cancer, with a special price, the
so-called “Ehren-Felix”.

We learned that colorectal cancer prevention is very effective, especially since the
foundation started its informational campaigns. But if the cancer is already formed and
spread, there are limited possibilities to cure a person. Therefore we chose to design a bi-
specific antibody targeting the T-cells of our immune system and colorectal cancer cells. To
tackle this challenge, we had great help of several experts in the field of recombinant
antibodies for immunotherapy. First of all Prof. Matthias Peipp had a tremendous impact on
the development of our bi-specific antibodies by aiding as a scientific advisor. He is working
for over ten years now on an antibody based immunotherapies by engineering specific
antibodies. Prof. Peipp also gave a talk at our Collaboration Meet Up, during which he
explained the great importance of the improvement of antibodies and antibody derivatives.
That encouraged us even more in our project and emphasized its great real life importance
even more to us. At the early stages of our project he discussed with us certain procedures
concerning strains used for expression, the appropriate vectors and suitable linker lengths
between our different construct domains. Prof. Peipp also supported the idea of a “Plug and
Play System”, a modular construction system that gives the opportunity to easily adjust to
other diseases besides colorectal cancer just by exchanging one of the binding heads. [Bild

Another expert in the field, Dr. Thomas Simon, supported us further with the design of our
constructs. He works as the head of the molecular biology at DIARECT AG, a biotech
company that develops and establishes standardized large-scale production of recombinant
and native proteins for diagnostics. They also developed Escherichia coli and mammalian cell
systems for the expression of their recombinant and native proteins. Therefore, he was able
to give advice in finding a suitable expression system. He explained their different
advantages and limitations and how to maximize production according to his extensive
experience. Especially with our aim to express our proteins in E. coli he could give us
important advices, since he already established such cell systems in the company. Dr. Simon
also helped us with the right choice of the expression vectors and different methods to test
the effectiveness of our bi-specific antibody. [Bild?]

We also had several discussions with Prof. Georg Fey, former head of the immunology
department in Erlangen, who is still working in the field of recombinant antibodies. His
current project is to develop so called triplebodies with dual targeting of CD33 and CD123
for the treatment of Acute Myeloid Leukemia. He also visited our Meet Up to learn more
about our project and discussed it with us. Furthermore, Prof. Fey was so kind to give an
interview in which he emphasized the impact a linker with its length and composition may
have on the efficacy of a fusion protein and especially on antibody derivatives. This also
raised the idea in our team to model different linker lengths with different linker
compositions to gather more Data. He also made us aware of the possible immunogenicity
of the Spy-Tag/Spy-Catcher System, joining the binding domains of the bi-specific antibody.
To address this issue we constructed a neuronal network that is able to predict an allergen
based on the amino acid sequence [Find out more]({{< ref "/awards/model.md" >}}). Additionally, Prof. Fey explained the advantages of
different mammalian cell systems for protein expression and how they are established in the
industry. [Bild Interview]

Last but not least, we received a lot of advice from our PI Prof. Thomas Winkler. Prof.
Winkler himself is a geneticist with a special focus on selection processes revolving around B
cell maturation and associated antibody-dependent immune responses. He supported the
project from the beginning onwards with discussing our ideas and recommending experts
which he thought to be useful for our project. Prof. Winkler also gave our team the
possibility to work in his laboratory and was always interested in discussing new upcoming
data or problems to progress the project.

We also aimed to bring the relatively new field of bispecific antibodies as a potential
curatives for to date hard to treat diseases into public. Therefore, we got the chance to
participate at the [Day of Immunology (DOI)](https://iuis.org) with our own information booth where
passerby could inform themselves about our project and discuss it with us. Also the ["Lange Nacht der Wissenschaften"](https://www.nacht-der-wissenschaften.de) gave us the opportunity to get into contact with people
not involved in the scientific field. In both occasions we received incredible feedback and
support for our project, really supporting the feeling that our project has an impact. Albeit
the fact, that those people did not necessarily have a background in molecular biology
talking to these people was really instructive and gave us personally the feeling that our
project is worth working on. While all the discussions were helpful on their own, through the
DOI we also got in contact with another expert in the field of immunology, Prof. Jäck. Prof.
Jäck engaged into a very interesting discussion and expressed his support, as he thought our
project to be an excellent approach for targeting colorectal cancer and potentially other
diseases with our “plug and play” system. [Bild DOI/ LNdW?]
